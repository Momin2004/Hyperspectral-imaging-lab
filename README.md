# Hyperspectral Imaging for Onion Classification

## **Overview**

This repository contains code and resources for hyperspectral imaging workflows, combining Python, C++, and HALCON tools. The project focuses on onion quality classification using machine learning, specifically XGBoost, with dimensionality reduction through Partial Least Squares (PLS). The dataset is processed, segmented, and used for training and inference to predict onion quality categories such as "goed," "interne rot," and "doorschot."
